# Hi everyone, I'm Fadi Al-Najar!

I'm a recent **Software Engineering** graduate from **ASAC**, eager to take the next step in my development journey. During my studies, I gained a strong foundation in various technologies, including:

* Java programming language
* Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts
* APIs
* Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
* Front-end development with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript 

## Next step
I'm currently enrolled in a .Net course and excited to dive deeper into this framework! I'm looking forward to connecting with fellow students and instructors, sharing my experiences, and learning from yours.  This course feels like the perfect stepping stone towards becoming Full Stack Developer.

## I've learned a lot from todays lecture, such as:
1. MarkDown language features
2. what is VCS and its binifits
3. git and github
4. some commands for terminal
